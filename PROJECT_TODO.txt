
low priority:
	- current ui system is kinda sus but i am liking it better than the last one i made
		- but i am not liking having to do_widget() with everything even if that part of the ui is disabled 
		just to preserve consistent uid's between frames no matter what.
			- test out mixing some retained stuff next time (mayhaps?)

	- instead of having the inventory inside the entity struct, change it to be an uid to an item and use that item's inventory as the entity inventory
	just because it makes the recursion easier in some parts, cuz right now i had to use a u16*

	- if right click while holding a stackable item, place 1 unit of that item
	- chest

	- UI element background


bugs/problems:
	- cooldown instantly resets sometimes if timed correctly
	- and just start cooldown if the spell is succesfully casted



main: //////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////			
	// i am beginning to think that autocycling spells without input is not the best idea

	// finally start making some survival/crafty stuff
	
	// i was originally thinking this was going to have combat so i needed to make an enemy
	// but CAN I focus the gameplay entirely on experimenting/researching with new spells 
	// and exploring the map, and make it fun without combat???
	
	// to do that i need to at least think about some interesting spells that don't revolve around combat
	// and that are worth putting time to get them
	// remember that 'no combat' doesn't mean 'no threats/enemies'
	// spell ideas:
		// invisibility
		// light
		// add impulse/dash
		// 

	// I will just do my original idea, playtest and check what part of the game people likes the most
	
	- add a crafting system
		- i am thinking of an in-world crafting system
		where i put items in some tiles/structure (and then throw a spell at it or something?)
		at least for crafting wands that'd be cool, not  sure if that'd work for everything
		
		- maybe there are transmutation spells and each spell turns certain items into other stuff
		or mixes items that can be mixed together
			- examples: melt turns ores into ingots
			- "tables" that can hold a spell and cast that spell on the items
			
	// how do i get spells
		// IDEA1
			// enemies hold wands and spells and when i kill them they drop em
			// can research spells i encounter that i didn't have before
			// and once i have researched a spell i can craft it
			// the main crafting material will be a juice(?) that i get by recycling spells and wands
		// IDEA2
			// spells have a "secret" craftin recipe that i need to research in some way to learn how to craft it
			// but how is that research process
				
	
	// farming side/resource collection stuff
		// if i don't include some sort of farming, crafting resources will probably be finite
			// maybe that's not a problem for the kind of gameplay that this "thing" will have but we'll see
			// or maybe i make the world automatically repopulate materials overtime 
			// instead of the player having to have dedicated farms for materials
			
	- add modifier spells, which add properties to the next non-modifier spell casted
		// both of these could be the same 
		// but then i would have to introduce some kind of health to each tile
		- modifier destroys tiles // replace current destroy spell with this
		- add damage

	- make more spells
		- fire property
		- ice property
		- gives light // i need a light system first
