gameplay
	- highlight/preview tile when a placeable is going to be placed
	- make wand's selected slot auto cycle when it's equipped
	
	- make everything cast-able as a spell (i swear i am not pushing off survival/crafting gameplay)
		- if the selected spell is not a spell
			- if inventory is editable(a wand) recursively begin casting everything inside of it
			- if inventory is !editable(something like a placeable_object) cast just the last spell
			
	- change perspective of the stone(i know i doesn't help gameplay but it will help me visuallize some stuff)
	
	- add modifier spells, which add properties to the next non-modifier spell casted
	- make spells
		- shoot a projectile
			- make some kind of projectile entity
			- and make some entity to test the projectile on
			
		// both of these could be the same 
		// but then i would have to introduce some kind of health to each tile
		- modifier destroys tiles // replace current destroy spell with this
		- add damage
		- teleport caster
		
	// finally start making some survival/crafty stuff
	
	// i was originally thinking this was going to have combat so i needed to make an enemy
	// but CAN I focus the gameplay entirely on experimenting/researching with new spells 
	// and exploring the map, and make it fun without combat???

	// to do that i need to at least think about some interesting spells that don't revolve around combat
	// and that are worth putting time to get them
	// remember that 'no combat' doesn't mean 'no threats/enemies'
	// spell ideas:
		// invisibility
		// light
		// add impulse/dash
		// 

	
	- add a crafting system
		- i am thinking of an in-world crafting system
		where i put items in some tiles/structure (and then throw a spell at it or something?)
		at least for crafting wands that'd be cool, not  sure if that'd work for everything
		
		- maybe there are transmutation spells and each spell turns certain items into other stuff
		or mixes items that can be mixed together
			- examples: melt turns ores into ingots
			- "tables" that can hold a spell and cast that spell on the items
			
	// how do i get spells
		// IDEA1
			// enemies hold wands and spells and when i kill them they drop em
			// can research spells i encounter that i didn't have before
			// and once i have researched a spell i can craft it
			// the main crafting material will be a juice(?) that i get by recycling spells and wands
		// IDEA2
			// spells have a "secret" craftin recipe that i need to research in some way to learn how to craft it
			// but how is that research process
				
	
	// farming side/resource collection stuff
		// if i don't include some sort of farming, crafting resources will probably be finite
			// maybe that's not a problem for the kind of gameplay that this "thing" will have but we'll see
			// or maybe i make the world automatically repopulate materials overtime 
			// instead of the player having to have dedicated farms for materials
			
	

	- make more spells (a lot later)
		- fire property
		- ice property
		// i need a light system first
		- gives light 
			
			
low priority
	- current ui system is kinda sus but i am liking it better than the last one i made
		- but i am not liking having to do_widget() with everything even if that part of the ui is disabled 
		just to preserve consistent uid's between frames no matter what.
			- test out mixing some retained stuff next time (mayhaps?)
